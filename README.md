# Lelapa AI Buzuzu-Mavi Challenge-Solution

## Description
This repository contains my solution for the Lelapa AI Buzuzu-Mavi Challenge competition. The challenge required adapting the SLM released by Lelapa AI (Inkuba LM) for three NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, yes/no QA, machine translation) across low-resource Swahili and Hausa languages.
